# JobzQuest Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders of the JobzQuest community, pledge to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone. We are committed to fostering a harassment-free experience regardless of age, body size, disability (visible or invisible), ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, sexual identity and orientation.

We strive to act in ways that promote diversity, inclusivity, empathy, and kindness within our community.

## Our Standards

To maintain a positive environment, we expect all community members to adhere to the following standards:

- Demonstrate empathy and kindness towards others.
- Respect differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Give and receive constructive feedback gracefully.
- Take responsibility for mistakes, apologize to those affected, and learn from the experience.
- Focus on what benefits the community as a whole, not just individual interests.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behavior is considered unacceptable within our community:

- Use of sexualized language or imagery, or any form of sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, derogatory comments, insults, or personal or political attacks.
- Harassment, whether public or private.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
- Any conduct that is deemed inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for enforcing these standards of behavior. They will address any inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful behavior promptly and fairly. Leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, or any other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They will provide an explanation for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and instances where an individual represents the JobzQuest community. This includes using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at online or offline events.

# Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. Please contact them through the mail to `rivikchoure65+jobzquest@gmail.com`. All complaints will be promptly and fairly reviewed and investigated.

All community leaders are obliged to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines to determine the consequences for violating this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction:** If inappropriate language or behavior is deemed unprofessional or unwelcome within the community, community leaders may provide a private, written warning. The warning will clarify the nature of the violation and explain why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

2. **Warning:** A warning may be issued for a single incident or a series of actions that violate community standards. Continued behavior may result in a specified period of no interaction with the involved individuals, including unsolicited contact with those enforcing the Code of Conduct. This includes abstaining from interactions in community spaces and external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

3. **Temporary Ban:** Serious violations of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, may result in a temporary ban. This entails a specified period of no interaction or public communication with the community. During this time, no public or private interaction with the involved individuals or those enforcing the Code of Conduct is permitted. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

4. **Permanent Ban:** A pattern of violating community standards, demonstrating sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment, or aggression toward individuals or groups, may result in a permanent ban from any public interaction within the community.
